Result of processing a chat message by an agent or one of its personas.
This return value determines how the chat manager proceeds:

 - Boolean `true`: The message has successfully handled. The manager doesn't
   need to do anything.

 - Boolean `false`: The message could not be handled and should probably be
   transferred to another agent. The manager will use the LLM to try and find
   another agent.

 - String: The message should be handed over to the agent with the given code.
