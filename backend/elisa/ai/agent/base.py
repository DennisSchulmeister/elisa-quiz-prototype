        Note:
            Usually, no response should be sent to the client if the agent cannot handle the
            message. Returning True means an agent response will be sent, but the response may
            still instruct the assistant to hand over to another agent, meaning the LLM ultimately
            decides if the message was handled.
        
        To handle the message create a response, call the assistant's `_send_assistant_chat_message()`
        or `_stream_assistant_chat_message()` methods and return True. Don't forget to include the user
        message in these calls! Return False or an agent code to hand-over to another agent.
